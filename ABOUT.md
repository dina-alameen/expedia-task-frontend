* For the back-end part of this task I used a REST web service implementation with Jackson for JSON parsing,  
  along with an angular 5 and bootstrap implementation for the front end part, 
  I used bootstrap to make use of its responsive features and used angular to benefit from the client side processing , 
  I also used PrimeNG components such as the calendar date fields and the spinner range field,
  i used the PrimeNg since it provides ready components that perfectly suits the requirements. 
  
* The front end angular project consists 2 main components: the form which handles the filtering ,
  and the search results components which renders the fetched offers.
* The back end part of the project consists of the Restful web service which delegate the work to the business class 
  that handles the communication with expedia service. 
  
* I have 17 months experience in Java EE development in general, and for the past 4 months I have been working with REST webservices
  and Angular technologies.
  
 * In this task i learned alot about packaging angular apps and about hosting the app on Heroku which I did not have any experiance in,
   I also learned more about unit testing and maven tests which I new a little bit about earlier.
